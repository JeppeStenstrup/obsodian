[[Software Maintenance Phase MOC]]

# Initiation

## Change Initiation
- Often starts with making [[User Story|user stories]].
	- A user asks for an enhancement
	- Programmer proposes an improvement
	- Manager wants to meet competitor's functionality

Format: `As a __, I want __, so that __`.

- Limit the complexity of the story and potential for misunderstanding
- User story fits on a 3"x5" card
- if a new functionality cannot fit, it has to be divided into several user stories

## Requirements form
- Tests are often made up against the user story, which is why well written user stories are very important.

## [[Product Backlog]]
- "Wish List"
- Add/Delete/Modify requirements
- Additional knowledge is acquired by the users
- Additional clarification is needed by the developer
