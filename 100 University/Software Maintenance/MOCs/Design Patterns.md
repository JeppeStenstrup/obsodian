# Design Patterns
- Emphasis on flexibility and reuse through decoupling of classes.
- The underlying principles:
	- I program to an interface, not to an implementation.
	- I favor composition over class inheritance.
	- I find what varies and encapsulate it.

- **[[Design Patterns#Structural Patterns|Structural Patterns]]**: Deal with decoupling interface and implementation of classes and objects.
- **[[Design Patterns#Behavioral Patterns|Behavioral Patterns]]**: Deal with dynamic interactions among societies of classes and objects.
