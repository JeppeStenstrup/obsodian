# Quality Attribute
## What is a Quality Attribute?
A Quality Attribute (QA) is a measurable or testable property of a system that is used to indicate how well the system satisfies the needs of its stakeholders beyond the basic function of the system

## The three problems when discussing system quality attributes:

1.  The definitions provided for an attribute is not testable. A system is always “[[Modifiability|modifiable]]” in one way or another. A system is never fully robust or resilient. It will always have its strengths and weaknesses.
2.  Issues belong to multiple qualities, and that’s okay. A Denial-of-Service attack can’t be put under only [[Availability|availability]] nor [[Security|security]]. They both handle the issue with respect to their own responsibility.
3.  Each attribute community has their own vocabulary. An occurrence to the system has, but are not limited to, names like “Events” ([[Performance]]), “Attacks” ([[Security]]), “Faults” ([[Availability]]) and “User input” ([[Usability]]). They may well be the same type of occurrence, but it may confuse the receiver of the information, as it is presented using other terms.
