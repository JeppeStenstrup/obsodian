## What is Software Architecture?
The basic principle of software architecture is every software system is constructed to satisfy an organization’s business goals, and that the architecture of a system is a bridge between those (often abstract) business goals and the final (concrete) resulting system.

## What Software Architecture is and what it isn't
The software architecture of a system is the set of structures needed to reason about the system. These structures comprise software elements, relations among them, and properties of both.

It’s hard to categorize “major” or “important” parts of a structure when presented to them, so instead of looking at the architecture as a pre-planning tool only, look at it as a reason-enabling tool throughout the project.

## Architecture is a set of Software Structures
Architecture are a collection of elements, held together by relation; not a single element.

The three categories of elements within an architecture is:

- [[Module Views]]
- [[Allocation Views]]
