# Documentation
## Purpose of documentation
- For better understanding, both for you and for the recipient.
- To better enable new people to get into a group, organization, or into an infrastructure
- To help the end-user manage the system
- Documentation can directly help clarify which quality attributes has been fulfilled

Documentation speaks for the architect. Instead of the architect having to answer questions every time others have to work with it, having documentation of the architecture, mapped out for different groups of interest, makes communicating the complex, rather simple.

Another use for the documentation is a guideline for the developers. The system their building is somewhat defined in a vague blueprint, of sorts, which makes it easy to track progress and overview in general.

Documentation is not only for production. A general overview of multiple aspects of the system can be valuable to anyone.
A company with a lot of projects would benefit immensely from having documented them all to a certain degree.

## Documentation Uses
### Educational
With proper documentation of a system, it is easy to introduce new developers/architects into a project, or introduce a customer to the uses of the system.

### Communication
Documentation also drives the communication between stakeholders.

In most cases stakeholders are not interested or does not have time to get into the technical specifics, so when communicating between stakeholders, presentations built on top of documentation is used.

In most cases, the one consuming the documentation is the architect him/herself. Projects almost always contain more information and detail than any one person can remember, therefore the documentation also serves as communication to the "future" architect.

### Analysis and Construction
As described earlier, documentation serves as a blueprint for the developers.
Documentation also describes how the systems dependencies, for which the developers must implement according.

The documentation is also base for evaluating system requirements.
Here it is possible to address quality attributes, such as [[Security|security]], [[Usability|usability]], [[Availability|availability]], and [[Modifiability|modifiability]].

### Forensics
When failures or incidents occur, documentation is key to track down where it went wrong. That is identifying the immediate cause and underlying cause.

This goes without saying, but documentation **always** has to be kept up to date.
