[[Views MOC]]

# Views

A view is a representation of a set (of a particular type) of system elements and relations among them.
Break out views (components, systems, etc.) into smaller diagrams to illustrate interrelations in a more manageable size.

Documenting an [[Architecture]] is a matter of documenting the relevant views and then adding [[Documentation]] that applies to more than one view.
_Make sure the document is relevant to the reader._
