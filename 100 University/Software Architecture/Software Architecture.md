## Learning objectives
### Knowledge
- Explain the **impact** of software architecture to software (systems) development.
- Describe methods for **specifying** and **eliciting** architectural **requirements**
- Describe the architecture of software systems associated **qualities**
- Explain the **link** between **software architecture**, **quality**, and **development context**
- Describe steps in the **selection** of appropriate software architecture **tactics** and **patterns**
- Explain software architecture **design decisions** and how to **create** an architectural **strategy**
- Describe steps in the **evaluation** of software architecture
- Differentiate software **architecture patterns** and software design patterns

### Skills
- Define software **requirements** for a software architecture
- Select software architecture **tactics** and **patterns** given specific **requirements**
- Transfer a selection of software architecture tactics and patterns into a **software design** and **implementation**
- Compare different software architecture **tactics** and **patterns** for a specific set of **requirements**
- Select and perform an appropriate software architecture quality **evaluation** method
- Document a software architecture in relevant **views**
- Apply **tools** to support the software architectural design and software development

### Competences
- Ability to apply software architecture methods to address tensions among different software **architectural qualities** and settle the tensions in a **concrete design**
