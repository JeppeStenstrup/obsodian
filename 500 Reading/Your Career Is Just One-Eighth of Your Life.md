> Telling young people who just graduated from college that a satisfying career is hopeless [until we dismantle capitalism](https://www.gawker.com/culture/failure-to-cope-under-capitalism) is about as helpful as telling somebody asking for directions to the bathroom that no true relief will visit humankind until death. - 

A career is, on average, 80000 hours long, which corresponds to 480 continuous weeks of work. The average human being is alive for approx. 4000 weeks, and 3000 weeks awake. That makes up to be approx. 16% of a lifetime.
