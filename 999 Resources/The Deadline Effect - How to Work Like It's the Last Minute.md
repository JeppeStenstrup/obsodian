# [[The Deadline Effect]] - How to Work Like It's the Last Minute

By giving a shorter deadline (realistic) on tasks, people tend to be better at delivering than if given longer.

The [[Ancient Greek]] had two words for time, the ordinary time, *[[Chronos|chronos]]*, the one that takes us from birth to death, and the word *[[Kairos|kairos]]*, which refers to the opportune moment.

The God representing Chronos is almost always depicted by an old man, whereas Kairos is depicted as a sprightly young man. Aesop described him as bold, but with a lock of hair draped over his forehead. "If you can grasp him from the front, you might be able to hold him, but once he has moved on not even Jupiter himself can pull him back."

[[The Deadline Effect]] is when a deadline has been set, but the work for the specific deadline gets delayed right up the last second.
